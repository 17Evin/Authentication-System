PYTHON

This Flask application serves as a web-based email verification system. Upon accessing the root route ('/'), users are presented with an HTML form ('index.html'). Upon submitting this form, the '/send_email' route is triggered via a POST request. This route generates a dynamic email containing a table of colors and corresponding random numbers. The email is sent to the address provided in the form, using Gmail's SMTP server and credentials.

The dynamic content, including colors and numbers, is generated by helper functions ('generate_colors' and 'generate_unique_random_numbers'). The email's body is constructed in HTML format, presenting the user with a table to select a number corresponding to their chosen color.

In case of a successful email transmission, the 'verific.html' template is rendered. If an error occurs during the email sending process, an error message is printed, and the same 'verific.html' template is rendered.

Additionally, there are routes for handling form submissions ('/submit_hello') and rendering a 'hello.html' template ('/hello'). The application can be run locally with debugging enabled.

environment used  
Flask: The web framework used for building the web application. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, and rendering HTML templates.

smtplib: The smtplib library is part of the Python standard library and is used for sending emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It is employed to connect to Gmail's SMTP server and send the generated email.

email.mime.multipart and email.mime.text: These modules from the email library are used to construct MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) messages. In this case, MIME is used to compose an HTML email.

random: The random module is utilized to shuffle and generate unique random numbers for the colors presented in the email.

Flask's request module: The request module from Flask is used to access data submitted in the HTML forms.

These components collectively enable the development of a web application that generates and sends dynamic emails for the purpose of verification. Additionally, it provides routes for handling form submissions and rendering HTML templates.


SIGN UP

The provided HTML code is a basic sign-up page with a responsive design and various styling elements. The page includes a form for user registration with fields for name, email, password, and a color selection dropdown. The form is configured to submit data to a Google Apps Script when the user clicks the "Sign Up" button.

The styling is done using inline CSS within a `<style>` tag in the HTML head. It features a background image, input fields with appropriate styling, a password toggle functionality to show or hide the password, and social icons for Google and Facebook sign-up options.

JavaScript is included to handle form submission via a fetch request to a specified Google Apps Script URL. Additionally, there are functions to toggle password visibility and change cursor styles. The script ensures that upon successful form submission, an alert is displayed, and the page is reloaded.

The code aims to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional sign-up page with a responsive layout, password visibility toggle, and integration with Google Apps Script for form handling.


APPSCRIPT EXPLAINATION

The provided Google Apps Script code is designed to handle HTTP POST requests and update a Google Sheet with the submitted data. The script consists of two main functions.

1. `intialSetup`: This function is executed to set up the initial configuration. It obtains the active spreadsheet's ID and stores it in the script properties using `PropertiesService`. This ensures that the script knows which spreadsheet to access.

2. `doPost`: This function is triggered when an HTTP POST request is received. It first acquires a script lock to prevent concurrent access. Then, it opens the spreadsheet using the stored ID and retrieves the specified sheet named 'Data'. The script extracts headers from the sheet, determines the next available row, and constructs a new row of data based on the received parameters. The new row is then appended to the sheet, and the lock is released.

The function returns a JSON response indicating the success or failure of the operation, along with details such as the new row number or any encountered errors. This script serves as a backend handler for form submissions, storing data securely in a Google Sheet.


LOGIN PAGE

The provided HTML and CSS code creates a stylish login page with various features. The background is set to a scenic image, and the layout is centered on the page using flexbox. The login form includes fields for a username (email) and password, with a toggle button to show/hide the password for user convenience.

The form incorporates client-side validation using JavaScript. When the user attempts to log in, the `sendOtp` function is triggered, checking if the entered email is correct as given and the password is not empty. If successful, an alert is shown, a color is stored in the local storage, and an email is sent to the entered address using the `send_email` function. If the login fails, an error alert is displayed.

Additionally, there is a "Forgot Password?" link and social media login options (Google and Facebook). The password input includes a visibility toggle, and the cursor changes on hover. The script also contains a function (`getColorFromSheet`) for fetching color data associated with email addresses from a Google Sheet, though it's not currently used in the provided code. Overall, the code combines design elements with interactive features for a user-friendly login experience.

VERIFIC PAGE

The provided HTML code represents a login page with an OTP (One-Time Password) verification feature. The page has a background image, styled form elements, and social media icons for potential integration. The login box is designed with a blurred backdrop, and the input fields for OTP entry are presented in a centered container.

Upon entering the OTP and clicking the "Submit" button, the JavaScript functions validate the entered OTP against an expected OTP generated based on a selected color. If the OTP is correct, an alert is displayed, indicating successful login, and the user is redirected to the 'hello.html' page. If the OTP is invalid, another alert prompts the user to try again.

Additionally, the code includes commented-out sections for potential features such as displaying a chosen color and utilizing an external CSS file ('login.css').

In summary, this HTML file creates a visually appealing and functional OTP login page with color-based OTP validation. The JavaScript functions handle OTP validation and redirection upon successful login.

HELLO PAGE
 
This is a simple page contains hello welcome message that shows after completed the verification. We can replace this page with any other page also it is just a sample page that opens after successful verification if the verification is not successful this page won't get open
